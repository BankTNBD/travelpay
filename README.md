### This is my first project with Next.js if you have any idea or knowledge feel FREE to tell me! is want that sm.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) built to learn how to use Next.js

## âœ¨Featureâœ¨
- Add a bill to remember your expenses
- Add person who you want to split the bill with!
- Calculate everyone's expenses on the trip

## ðŸ˜€ FunFact
After clicking add bill and add person, the page reloads to show the div element you added. I think there is a better way to add the div element on the reload page, but I DON'T KNOW. Can anyone tell me? I'm new to Next.js ðŸ˜£

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
